                                    us to comprehend these definitions rather quickly. In order to solve these problems,
                                    analyse the given statements carefully and systematically.

                                    Questions on Blood Relationship can be solved by any of the following methods:

                                    While attempting questions on Blood Relationship, first read all the pieces of
                                    information as quickly as possible and then point out the two persons between whom
                                    relationship is to be established. Finally, try to co-relate the given
                                    relationships.
                                </p>

                                    While concluding relationship between two persons be careful about the genders of
                                    the persons involved. Majority of the students tend to define or derive relationship
                                    without caring for gender of the persons.
