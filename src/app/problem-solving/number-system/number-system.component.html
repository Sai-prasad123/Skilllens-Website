                    The chapter on Number Systems is amongst the most important chapters in the entire syllabus of Quant for the MBA /BANK /SSC /RRB examinations .Students are advised to go through this chapter with utmost care understanding each concept and question type on this topic. The CAT has consistently contained anything between 25â€“40% of the marks based on questions taken from this chapter. Naturally, this chapter becomes one of the most crucial as far as your quest to reach close to the qualification score in the section of Quantitative Aptitude is concerned. Hence, going through this chapter and its concepts properly is imperative for you. It would be a good idea to first go through the basic definitions of all types of numbers. Also closely follow the solved examples based on various concepts discussed in the chapter. Also, the approach and attitude while solving questions on this chapter is to try to maximize your learning experience out of every question. Hence, do not just try to solve the questions but also try to think of alternative processes in order to solve the same question. Refer to hints or solutions only as a last resort. To start off, the following pictorial representation of the types of numbers will help you improve your quality of comprehension of different types of numbers.
