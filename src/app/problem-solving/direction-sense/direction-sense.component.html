                  <p>
                    In this type of questions, a successive follow up of
                    directions and/or distance is formulated and on the basis of
                    given information you are required to ascertain the final
                    direction with respect to the starting point or the shortest
                    distance between the starting point and the final point.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes both the final direction and the distance covered
                    are asked. Thus, in this test, the questions consist of sort
                    of direction and/or distance puzzle. Obviously, such questions
                    are meant to judge the candidateâ€™s ability to trace, follow
                    and perceive the direction, described in somewhat complicated
                    language, correctly. In order to solve such questions
                    correctly you must have the knowledge or directions on the
                    plane of a paper.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the same time, it is necessary to sketch out the directions
                    as per information provided in the question in proper
                    sequence. An error at any point would alter your answer
                    choice.
